The _Wired_ [article][wired-article], entitled _The Most Important Startup's
Hardest Worker Isn't a Person,_ inspires an array of possibilities for business
models based on chatbots.

This recalls the vision of an intelligent agent that can interface with
disparate applications or APIs, and provide a uniform (preferrably spoken or
conversational) interface to the data they provide and the functions they
perform. (See [Cognitive Code](http://www.cognitivecode.com/). Update:
Microsoft recently [purchased][msft-purchase] a company called [Wand
Labs](http://wandlabs.com/) which was chartered to "tear down app walls,
integrate your services in chat and make them work together.")

The value propositions of Hubot seem to be

* Ubiquitously available (at least within the company and its culture)
* access to diverse functions and information
* through a single interface used for human conversations.
* A transcript that provides conversational context for events.

Hubot and other bots appear to have insinuated themselves into the chat systems
increasingly used by employees for communication, providing automated functions
in the context of those conversations. Another _Wired_
[article][wired-article2], entitled _Slack is Overrun With Bots. Friendly,
Wonderful Bots,_ indicates that bots have made Slack "much, much more than a 
communication tool"

[Lita](https://www.lita.io/) and
[Errbot](http://errbot.io/en/latest/) are alternatives to Hubot that are also
open-source.

We can imagine a business that implements one or more chatbots within an
organization, using open-source and closed-source technology to deliver the
above benefits to employees.

One problem the article points out is that "The system has a 'command line'
feel to it...you have to use specific commands for it to work...Labert tries to
remember the command for asking Hubot which food trucks are nearby. He can't."
The conversational benefit comes primarily from the interface being embedded in
a conversational communication tool, not from actual conversational interaction
with the bot. In other words, natural language interaction technology would be
a competitive advantage for the envisioned business
